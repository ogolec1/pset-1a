  <p> The highschool I attend is one of my favorite places. Although I do not like the work aspect of school, I still enjoy seeing my friends everyday. School is obviously a great experience for everyone because it is a place to meet new people and explore your interests. </p>
  <p> I also am participating in the following clubs </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Student Leadership Council</li>
    <li>Robotics Club</li>
    <li> Newspaper Club </li>
    <li> Relay For Life </li>
    <li> Yearbook Club </li>
    <li> TSA </li>
</ul>
<p> These clubs are really entertaining and get me involved with the school. Student Leadership Council has given me the opportunity to interact with the other classes and create solutions to better our school. As sophomore historian, I also love to take pictures of my classmates and put them into the Yearbook Club. Robotics and TSA are two clubs that involve engineering that I am currently interested in learning more about. Relay for Life is probably my favorite club from the list because it has the most impact on people. Raising money for charity is not only benefiting me but is benefiting others. Also, it is a very fun experience. All of these clubs are clubs that I really enjoy attending and hope to continue and pursue them through highschool. </p>
