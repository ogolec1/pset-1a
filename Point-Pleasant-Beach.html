<p> Like most people, during the summer I love to go to the beach. I love visiting the ocean which is why saying goodbye to summer is a bit more rough. I like any beach but, my favorite beach in New Jersey would be Point Pleasant. Point Pleasant has a really nice boardwalk. The boardwalk is really fun to visit because they have a lot of rides and shops. </p>
