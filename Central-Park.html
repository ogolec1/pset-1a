<p> One of my favorite places to go to is the famous, Central Park.Central Park is the largest and most important public park in Manhattan, New York City. Not only is it huge, it is beautiful. There are so many amazing sights to see in this park. If a relaxing walk or jog is not fitting for you there are also tons of events held in Central Park. I love to come here on weekends with my friends and my dog to walk around and capture the beauty of nature.  </p>
